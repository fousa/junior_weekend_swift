# Junior Weekend 2016

The first time I try to create a _"production"_ server application in Swift. This website will handle the registrations for the Junior Weekend organised in Brasschaat.

## Setup

Clone the project and run the "Junior Weekend" scheme from Xcode. This will start a server instance, and you will be able to browse to it.
